altText: 'A mug sat on a log in front of a fire in the woods that reads: Not all who
  wander are lost.'

All that is gold does not glitter,   
Not all those who wander are lost;   
The old that is strong does not wither,   
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.   
From the ashes, a fire shall be woken,   
A light from the shadows shall spring;   
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,   
The crownless again shall be king
