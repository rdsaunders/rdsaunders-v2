caption: "A stop on the route between Pienza and San Quirico d'orcia, Tuscany, Italy Having spent the morning in Siena it only seemed right to go on a road trip through the Val d'Orcia. We wanted to capture some of the golden hour on our return from Montepulciano, we were a little early but still enjoyed absorbing the Tuscan scenery."
