title: Mark Boulton - The ugly truth about design systems
link: https://vimeo.com/356885057
excerpt: Design systems are great for scaling design across complex organisations
  and products. But in our drive for scale, consistency and standards, have we considered
  the risks and the cost? What are the problems we may face and how can we overcome
  them? In this talk, Mark will expose the ugly truth of rolling out design systems;
  from engineering and code, to designers and stakeholders and provide guidance from
  his experience of producing design systems for over a decade.
