title: Garret Miller - The gradual design system
link: https://vimeo.com/356898983
excerpt: "As Slack has rapidly scaled, we've built our own component library that
  outlines our product foundations and interface elements. In the process, we found
  that the most important output of our work isn't just the design system, but rather
  the processes that define how we work together with shifting priorities and a rapidly
  scaling product. \n\nLearn about what we've built, the hiccups we've encountered
  along the way, and how the work we're doing now will pave the way for an even more
  powerful Slack in the future."
