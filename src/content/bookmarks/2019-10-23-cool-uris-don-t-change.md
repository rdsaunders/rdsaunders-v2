excerpt: 'Cool URIs don''t change What makes a cool URI? A cool URI is one which does
  not change. What sorts of URI change? URIs don''t change: people change them. There
  are no reasons at all in theory for people to change URIs (or stop maintaining documents),
  but millions of reasons in practice.'
