title: Change aversion and the conflicted user
link: https://usabilitygeek.com/change-aversion-conflicted-user/
excerpt: Change aversion, much like change itself, is a divisive topic.  One camp
  asserts that users hate change. Software users have “baby duck syndrome” – imprinting
  on the first system they learn and judging later iterations by their similarity
  to the first.
