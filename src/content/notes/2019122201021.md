So Joy and I managed to get a date night. It’s felt like months since we’ve had child free time. I booked a table at The New Court Inn in Usk. Not via personal recommendation but from trip advisor reviews. 

It was so nice to go somewhere different, it was only a 20 minutes drive from home and felt like we were miles away. 

The restaurant was quiet, but didn’t feel like we were the only ones there so close to Christmas. The staff were really friendly and attentive but didn’t get in the way. 

Joy choose slow braised Welsh lamb shank with rosemary infused pommes puree and poached baby leeks. I went for the Usk Valley 8oz rib eye Steak, served with confit tomatoes flat cap mushroom and triple cooked chips with a peppercorn sauce. ￼

I don’t usually eat steak out as it’s always a disappointment but it was cooked to perfection. Joys lamb shank was on the larger side, it just slipped off the bone and was accompanied well with the rosemary purée. 

I had a pint of festive Santa’s Sack I can’t remember the brewery now but it was simple ale at 3.7abv. As I was driving was sufficient to go with my meal.

It wasn’t a late night as mum was babysitting, but was so good to spend some time together. Hopefully we’ll head back before long.
