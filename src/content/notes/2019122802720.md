Well I never knew this until today:

> “Take a11y, for example. You might know what a11y means if you’ve heard of i18n—they’re both alphanumeric acronyms. A11y stands for “accessibility” and i18n for “internationalization”. The letters between the first and last have been replaced by a number representing the number of missing letters.”

Excerpt From
Accessibility for Everyone
