Cold and misty autumn mornings highlight the delightful intricacies of these patterns. Their structure sits amongst the bushes and long grass as water droplets hang from their flexible frame.

Glistening, shining, shimmering against the backdrop of another year passing, blowing in the breeze they await their prey.

Easily broken by accidental passing the silky threads cling against the warmth of human skin.

Another net broken, a new beginning, another opportunity, nature continues and a new web is spun.
