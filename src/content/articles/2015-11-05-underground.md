A busy day ends with a frantic rush through the rat runs below the big smoke. Satisfying moments of cool air pass through the maze of intermingled tunnels. The body craves those moments as your crammed amongst the multitude who are passing through the same place.

The heat generated by the bodies which fill the void below the service intensifies as you feel droplets of warm sweat run down you back.

The pace of the city is suited to some, I simply desire the quietness of home, the warmth of a fire and being close to the one that I love, to replace the void of the day.
