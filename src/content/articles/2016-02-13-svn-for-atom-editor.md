I've become a recent convert to Atom Editor from Sublime Text and I really appreciate the highlighting in the treeview of a project when items have been added, edited or deleted since a recent commit to a GitHub repo.

We're currently using SVN in work and Atom only supports this feature against GitHub repo's out of the box. There is a nice little package that provides the same support for SVN repo's by [andischerer](https://github.com/andischerer).

## To Install the package

1. Open Atom
2. Goto Preferences
3. Select Install
4. Search for SVN against packages
5. Click install on the SVN package by andischerer
6. Job Done!
