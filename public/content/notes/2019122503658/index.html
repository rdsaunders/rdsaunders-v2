    <p>This year we spent time with Joys family for Christmas. We’ve been battling with Chicken Pox for the last few days. Thankfully Christmas morning saw a little bit of a reprieve for our eldest.</p>
<p>We spent the morning at home opening stockings on our bed, before heading to Cardiff for Christmas lunch.</p>
<p>Ruth could t join us with an upset stomach and my throat felt pretty sore. It’s pretty common for me to come down with something before I finish for the holidays and this year was no exception.</p>
<p>The day was a fairly relaxed affair, Joys mum put together a great spread with plenty to keep us going. We had a short break before pudding, time for the kids to let off some steam on the field, Esra to stretch his legs and E and M a chance to play in the park.</p>
<p>We got back in time to hear the Queens speech whilst E and I sat down to our first instalment of Lego. I really love those moments with her.</p>
<p>We managed some Christmas pudding and profiteroles before clearing up and heading to Joys brothers.</p>
<p>The evening continued with another family tradition of Christmas tree presents, the spoon game and more buffet food to stretch the belly further.</p>
<p>The nephews were a little dismayed to plug in their new Xbox only to have to wait for a 61gb download!</p>
<p>It was a great day, although by the time we got home we were all ready for bed. Christmas is certainly exhausting with two kids, it’s going to be a difficult ball game next year with three.</p>
