    <h1>Why the GOV.UK Design System team changed the input type for numbers - Technology in government</h1>

    <p>Really interesting insight to the number input type. Especially the focus on accessibility and the silent loss of non number user input. Love the level of effort that the GDS team take to investigate these issues.</p>
