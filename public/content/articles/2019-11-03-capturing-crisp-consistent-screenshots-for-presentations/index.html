    <h1>Capturing crisp consistent screenshots for presentations</h1>

    <p>I prepare slide decks in Keynote a couple of times a year. You can guarantee that there will be a handful of screenshots of a website, code editor or some sort of application amongst the deck.</p>
<p>I have an incessant need for consistency when it comes to preparing a deck and I want to ensure that the screenshots I produce are as crisp as possible. After all most projectors suck, so its worthwhile taking the extra steps to convey what you want in the clearest way possible.</p>
<p>I also like to include movement in my slides so will often scale images up to focus peoples attention on a particular area of a user interface.</p>
<p>I thought it would be helpful to share some of the steps I take when capturing screenshots to get the most out of them.</p>
<h2>Turn off drop shadows on Mac OS screenshots</h2>
<p>If you are capturing a screenshot of an application frame on Mac OS, by default a box shadow will be included in the screenshot. This shadow makes the image larger and may affect the design of your deck. I use the <em>Shadow</em> option in Keynote when I need to add some separation to the background.</p>
<p>To toggle the box shadow you'll need to use the following commands in the terminal.</p>
<h3>Disable drop shadow</h3>
<p>To turn off the drop shadow use the following terminal</p>
<pre><code>defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true
</code></pre>
<p>Followed by</p>
<pre><code>killall SystemUIServer
</code></pre>
<h3>Enable drop shadow</h3>
<p>It can easily be switched back on to.</p>
<pre><code>defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool false
</code></pre>
<p>Followed by</p>
<pre><code>killall SystemUIServer
</code></pre>
<h2>Capture screenshots on a Retina display</h2>
<p>This is my number one tip and I've been using this since I had my first retina MacBook. Capturing screenshots on a Retina display ensures you get screenshot that is twice the resolution than you would get from a non-retina display.</p>
<p>As I usually create my presentations at a resolution of 1920x1080 this ensures I have plenty of resolution in an image available for scaling up when necessary.</p>
<h2>Create a empty profile to avoid disabling of extensions</h2>
<p>If you are capturing screenshots within a browser, I usually create a separate profile that does not include any extensions. It also means I can minimise the UI by turning off the bookmarks bar.</p>
<h2>Use a window resize extension</h2>
<p>The only extension I usually have enabled (but hidden from the toolbar) is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh">Window Resizer</a>, its a great extension that allows me to create screenshots of websites at a consistent size.</p>
<p>I use the shortcut key <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd>+<kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>↓ Down arrow</kbd> to cycle through my presets.</p>
<p>I'll often capture a website at 1680x1050 / 1440x900 depending on the amount of detail I require.</p>
<h2>Use Chromes command pallet</h2>
<p>If I want to capture a screenshot of a website without the browser chrome, I'll use Chromes command pallet feature. With the developer tools option <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd>+<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>, press <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to open the command pallet.</p>
<p>Type Screen into the command pallet and you'll see four options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capture area screenshot</strong> – This option will give you a cross hair cursor to drag an area you want to screenshot.</li>
<li><strong>Capture full size screenshot</strong> – Great for capturing the entirety of a long webpage without needing to scroll.</li>
<li><strong>Capture node screenshot</strong> - Capturing a specific selected node in the Elements tab. Great for screen grabbing a particular UI component.</li>
<li><strong>Capture screenshot</strong> – Screen capture the current viewport.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each option will save a screenshot into your downloads folder.</p>
<hr>
<p>Just using one of these tips should help you create better screenshots in your presentations without needing any additional software <em>(except maybe a free window size extension)</em>.</p>
