    <h1>Cobwebs</h1>

    <p>Cold and misty autumn mornings highlight the delightful intricacies of these patterns. Their structure sits amongst the bushes and long grass as water droplets hang from their flexible frame.</p>
<p>Glistening, shining, shimmering against the backdrop of another year passing, blowing in the breeze they await their prey.</p>
<p>Easily broken by accidental passing the silky threads cling against the warmth of human skin.</p>
<p>Another net broken, a new beginning, another opportunity, nature continues and a new web is spun.</p>
