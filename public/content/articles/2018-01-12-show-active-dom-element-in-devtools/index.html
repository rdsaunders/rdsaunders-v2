    <h1>Show active DOM element in DevTools</h1>

    <p>Sometimes you find yourself trying to identify a weird bug in a piece of UI and often DevTools comes to the rescue to help you out.</p>
<p>I was experiencing an issue this week where a UI element wouldn't click and get focus without pressing it twice, it only occurred in a particular scenario and it was getting frustrating.</p>
<p>Using DevTools and particularly the console I was able to track down the element that was getting focus and preventing my UI component from being clicked first time by using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/activeElement" title="document.activeElement property on MDN docs ">activeElement</a> JavaScript property.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the DevTools console by pressing <code>Cmd+Opt+J</code> Mac or <code>Ctrl+Shift+J</code> Windows / Linux</li>
<li>Typing the following property in the console will return the current active DOM element.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-js">document.activeElement
</code></pre>

<p>By using this simple property I could track down the offending component and fix the issue.</p>
