    <h1>SVN for Atom editor</h1>

    <p>I've become a recent convert to Atom Editor from Sublime Text and I really appreciate the highlighting in the treeview of a project when items have been added, edited or deleted since a recent commit to a GitHub repo.</p>
<p>We're currently using SVN in work and Atom only supports this feature against GitHub repo's out of the box. There is a nice little package that provides the same support for SVN repo's by <a href="https://github.com/andischerer">andischerer</a>.</p>
<h2>To Install the package</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open Atom</li>
<li>Goto Preferences</li>
<li>Select Install</li>
<li>Search for SVN against packages</li>
<li>Click install on the SVN package by andischerer</li>
<li>Job Done!</li>
</ol>
