    <h1>Weeknotes #8</h1>
<p>As I expected I fell off the bandwagon of writing my weeknotes. I'm thinking I need to take a simpler approach similar to Mark Boulton and bullet point the key takeaways from the week.</p>
<ul>
<li>It was my first week back at Zengenti, not including those first few days of the new year. I was looking forward to getting my head into a familiar routine.</li>
<li>Had a great week at Bluestone last week ending on the beach in Tenby. Really enjoyed switching off.</li>
<li>Spent a fair amount of time discussing process between the design and UI development team, as we focus on a new design system for Contensis.</li>
<li>Accessibility of our forms module came up in conversation and how we plan to address a few rendering scenarios. It's stood the test of time well. We've got some options for the future.</li>
<li>Spent some time using Voice Over and getting more familiar with it.</li>
<li>Dug into Storybook for documenting our components and how we could bring richer documentation together covering design, accessibility, behaviour and code.</li>
<li>Had various conversations about UI behaviour in a bunch of scenarios. I want to be careful this year on balancing genuine bugs against edge case scenarios.</li>
<li>Wrote a blog post on our recent search changes to go out with the next release.</li>
<li>Continued to watch what I eat this week, it's been good to see the progress but I also know how easy it is to get back into bad habits, a biscuit here, and a biscuit there.</li>
<li>Been enjoying longer walks with Esra, nearly hitting the 10,000 step mark before I start work which has given me time to listen to <a href="https://www.bibleinoneyear.org/">BiOY</a>, the <a href="https://fishandscripts.com/">Fish and Scripts</a> podcast as well as some episodes of <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/jamstack-radio/">JAMstack Radio</a>.</li>
<li>Managed to get another run in this week, its hard getting back into something that I used to have no problem doing.</li>
<li>Celebrated Heaths 40th, with a group of friends from church over breakfast.</li>
<li>Rotated the log store, the front cord has taken a beating from the weather, so managed to re stack, split a few larger pieces and got things tidied up. I love splitting stacking and sorting wood. Something about being outside, listening to the maul hitting a block and stacking the cords like Tetris.</li>
<li>Changed an inner tube of E's balance bike. Its funny how the smell of the rubber brings back memories from when I was in my early teens, thats the last time I'd changed one.</li>
</ul>
