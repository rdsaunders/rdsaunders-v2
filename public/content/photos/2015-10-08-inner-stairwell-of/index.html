    <title>Inner stairwell of Torre del Mangia, Siena, Italy


We arrived early at the tower to avoid the crowds and to enjoy the dry weather as it was due to rain in the afternoon. Only 25 people are allowed to climb the 503 steps of the tower at any time. It reaches a height of 102m giving great views across Siena.</title>
