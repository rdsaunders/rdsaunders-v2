    <h1>Not all those who wander are lost</h1>

    <p>All that is gold does not glitter,<br>
Not all those who wander are lost;<br>
The old that is strong does not wither,<br>
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.<br>
From the ashes, a fire shall be woken,<br>
A light from the shadows shall spring;<br>
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br>
The crownless again shall be king</p>
