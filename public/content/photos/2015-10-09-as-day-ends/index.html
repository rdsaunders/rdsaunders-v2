    <title>As the day ends, Il Poderaccio, Siena, Italy


Strangely this was the first sunset we managed to capture. The days have been so busy that we&#39;ve flopped in the evening. Enjoyed a lovely meal out in  Osteria Cacio E Pepe Vagliagli, this is the skyline that greeted us as we went out for the evening.</title>
