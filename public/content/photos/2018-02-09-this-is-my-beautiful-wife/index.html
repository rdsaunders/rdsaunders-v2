    <h1>My beautiful wife</h1>

    <p>This is my wife, she is beautiful, inside and out. Life is better with her, shes selfless, caring, an amazing mum and friend. She’s honouring, God fearing, and steadfast in her faith. She is strong, yet quiet, a constant encourager and amazing listener. This is my wife and I’m so thankful to God for her.</p>
<p>“An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels.” – ‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭31:10‬ ESV ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀</p>
